# Learning RL

In this project, I gonna implement the classic and popular reinforcement learning algorithms.

By doing so, I hope to deepen my understanding of the algorithms.

## Structure

- **tinyRL/agents**

  Contain some implementations of recent methods using PyTorch.

- **tinyRL/util**

  Contain the implementation of neural networks, common functions and classes.

- **demo/tabular**
  Cover the basic tabular methods from *Reinforcement Learning: An Introduction*.

- **demo/approximation**
  Cover the approximation methods with deep neural network using Jupyter notebook.
