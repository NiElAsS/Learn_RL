# Learning RL

In this project, I gonna implement the classic and popular reinforcement learning algorithms.

By doing this, I hope to deepen my understanding of the algorithms.

## Structure
- **demo/tabular**
  Cover the basic tabular methods from *Reinforcement Learning: An Introduction*.

- **demo/approximation**
  Cover the approximation methods with deep neural network.
